This file is a complete reboot of the AC3D export script that is used to export .ac format file into blender.

Reference to the .ac format is found here:
http://www.inivis.com/ac3d/man/ac3dfileformat.html

Some noted points that are important for consideration:
 - AC3D appears to use Left Handed axes, but with Y oriented "Up". Blender uses Right Handed axes, the export does provide a rotation matrix applied to the world object that corrects this, so "Up" in the blender becomes "Up" in the .AC file - it's configurable, so you can change how it rotates...
 - AC3D supports only one texture per surface. This is a UV texture map, so only blenders texmap is exported
 - Blender's Materials can have multiple textures per material - so a material + texure in AC3D requires a distinct and unique material in blender. The export uses a comparison of material properties to see if a material is the same as another one and then uses that material index for the .ac file.

TODO: Option to define "DefaultWhite" material
TODO: Optionally over-write existing textures
